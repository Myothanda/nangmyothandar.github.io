            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! </p>
            <p>I am Nang Myo Thandar Win, currently work as a Quality Assurance Engineer at Wave Money Company.As a Quality Assurance Engineer at Wave Money, I participate in system specification meetings, design reviews, use case reviews, and requirement gathering, and develop comprehensive test cases and test plans for projects. I have 10 months of experience in performing functional and non-functional testing, including integration, system, and user acceptance testing, as well as usability and compatibility testing. I also collaborate with the Automation testing team and run test scripts using Appium, a tool for testing mobile applications.</p>
            <p>I have over 5 years of working experience as a Quality Assurance professional, having previously worked as a Software Quality Assurance Tester at Onepay and a Quality Assurance Specialist at Tara Aung Co., Ltd. I have gained hands-on experience in creating and executing test scenarios for various applications, such as CMS, POS, and social media, using project tracking tools like Zoho, Jira, and Trello, and automation testing tools like Selenium. I have also assisted developers with issue analysis, presented software demos and collected feedback from clients, prepared user guides and training documents, and performed software installation at client sites. I am an independent, dynamic, and technologically inclined problem solver, with good communication and documentation skills, and an excellent team player within and across departments.</p>
